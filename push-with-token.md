# How to Push with Personal Access Token

## Step 1: Create a Personal Access Token
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name like "JFS Landing Page"
4. Select the scope: **repo** (check the box)
5. Click "Generate token" at the bottom
6. **COPY THE TOKEN** - you'll only see it once!

## Step 2: Use the Token
When you run the push command, use your token as the password:
- Username: `jagdishop090`
- Password: `[paste your token here]`

Or I can configure it for you once you have the token.
